Here is your evaluation rubric:

High-Quality Textbook Extracts have the following:
* Readability: The extract is easy to understand, employing consistent terminology, clear sentence structures, and meaningful examples, if applicable.
* Depth of Content: The extract covers its specific topic(s) in adequate depth, encapsulating both foundational and nuanced details.
* Detailed Explanations: Accompanying explanations within the extract clarify concepts and techniques, enhancing understanding.

Medium-Quality Textbook Extracts have the following:
* Readability: The extract is mostly readable but may have occasional terminology inconsistencies or less lucid examples.
* Adequate Depth of Content: The extract presents a reasonable scope of material but might not offer comprehensive or advanced coverage.
* Some Explanations: Limited explanations or examples provide only a general understanding of the topic.

Low-Quality Textbook Extracts have the following:
* Poor Readability: The extract is difficult to follow due to inconsistent terminology, unclear sentence structures, or ambiguous examples.
* Shallow Depth of Content: The extract lacks in-depth information, skimming over key points or presenting surface-level details.
* Limited Explanations: The extract includes minimal or no additional explanations, leaving readers without much guidance.
* Boilerplate and Redundant: The extract contains excessive repetition or irrelevant information, compromising comprehension and usability.

The extract is text only, and does not include images or diagrams, so do not penalize it for not including visual aids.

First write a few sentences explaining your rationale.  Then label the quality of the textbook extract with a 1-3 score, where 3 is high-quality, 2 is medium-quality, and 1 is low-quality.
