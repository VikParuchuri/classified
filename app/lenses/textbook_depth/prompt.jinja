# 8.2 Equilibrium Prices As Aggregators

Equilibrium prices can be thought of as aggregators of individual demands. Each investor in the market has their own demand function, which represents their willingness to buy or sell assets at different prices. The equilibrium prices are obtained by summing up the demands of all investors in the market.

To formalize the concept of equilibrium prices, let's consider a simple model with two investors, Investor 1 and Investor 2. Each investor has their own demand function, denoted as c1(x) and c2(x), where x represents the price of the asset.

The aggregate demand in the market is given by the sum of the demands of the individual investors, that is, c1(x) + c2(x). The equilibrium prices are obtained by setting the aggregate demand equal to the aggregate supply, which represents the total amount of the asset available in the market.

In the model, the aggregate supply is denoted as ω(x). The equilibrium condition can be written as c1(x) + c2(x) = ω(x). This equation states that the total demand for the asset should equal the total supply in the market.

Solving the equilibrium condition for x, we obtain the equilibrium prices as a function of the demands and the aggregate supply. The specific form of the equilibrium prices will depend on the functional forms of the demand functions and the aggregate supply.

3.2 Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis in trees. These include environmental factors, such as light intensity, temperature, and the availability of water and nutrients. Genetic factors and the health of the tree can also influence the efficiency of photosynthesis.

In the following, we will have a close look at what we can do with vectors (elements of the vector space). In particular, we can add vectors together and multiply them with scalars. The closure property guarantees that we end up with another vector in the same vector space. It is possible to find a set of vectors with which we can represent every vector in the vector space by adding them together and scaling them. This set of vectors is a basis, and we will discuss them in Section 2.6.1. Before we get there, we will need to introduce the concepts of linear combinations and linear independence.

Definition 2.11 (Linear Combination).

Consider a vector space V and a finite number of vectors x1, . . . , xk ∈ V . Then, every v ∈ V of the form

v = λ1x1 + · · · + λkxk = kX i=1 λixi ∈ V (2.65)

with λ1, . . . , λk ∈ R is a linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xk.

The 0-vector can always be written as the linear combination of k vec- tors x1, . . . , xk because 0 = Pki=1 0xi is always true.

In the following, we are interested in non-trivial linear combinations of a set of vectors to represent 0, i.e., linear combinations of vectors x1, . . . , xk, where not all coefficients λi in (2.65) are 0.

Definition 2.12 (Linear (In)dependence).

Let us consider a vector space V with k ∈ N and x1, . . . , xk ∈ V . If there is a non-trivial linear combination, such that 0 = Pk
i=1 λixi with at least one λi̸ = 0, the vectors x1, . . . , xk are linearly dependent. If only the trivial solution exists, i.e., λ1 = . . . = λk = 0 the vectors x1, . . . , xk are linearly independent.

Linear independence is one of the most important concepts in linear algebra. Intuitively, a set of linearly independent vectors consists of vectors that have no redundancy, i.e., if we remove any of those vectors from the set, we will lose something. Throughout the next sections, we will formalize this intuition more.

Example 2.13 (Linearly Dependent Vectors)

A geographic example may help to clarify the concept of linear independence. A person in Nairobi (Kenya) describing where Kigali (Rwanda) is might say ,“You can get to Kigali by first going 506 km Northwest to Kampala (Uganda) and then 374 km Southwest.”. This is sufficient information to describe the location of Kigali because the geographic coordinate system may be considered a two-dimensional vector space (ignoring altitude and the Earth’s curved surface). The person may add, “It is about 751 km West of here.” Although this last statement is true, it is not necessary to find Kigali given the previous information (see Figure 2.7 for an illustration). In this example, the “506 km Northwest” vector (blue) and the “374 km Southwest” vector (purple) are linearly independent. This means the Southwest vector cannot be described in terms of the Northwest vector, and vice versa. However, the third “751 km West” vector (black) is a linear combination of the other two vectors, and it makes the set of vectors linearly dependent. Equivalently, given “751 km West” and “374 km Southwest” can be linearly combined to obtain “506 km Northwest”.

# 5. The Hurricane Comes Later: Early Battles and Strategies

The Civil War began in 1861 with a series of early battles and strategies that set the stage for the conflict to come. This section of the textbook explores these early events and their significance in shaping the course of the war.

One of the first major battles of the war was the First Battle of Bull Run, also known as the First Battle of Manassas. This battle took place on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia. It was a Confederate victory and demonstrated the unpreparedness and inexperience of both the Union and Confederate armies. The battle also shattered the illusion that the war would be short and decisive, and instead foreshadowed the long and bloody conflict that lay ahead.

Another significant early battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter, which marked the beginning of the war. Fort Sumter, located in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, was occupied by Union forces. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces under General P.G.T. Beauregard bombarded the fort, forcing its surrender. This event galvanized both the North and the South and led to the mobilization of troops and the outbreak of war.
